# EMG-Analysis-example
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`EMG_Analyze_Multi_Segment.ipynb`) for analyzing EMG (electromyography) signals, especially from mouse experiments. It enables flexible, segment-wise analysis of EMG amplitude and frequency characteristics, leveraging the power of NeuroKit2.
